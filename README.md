## Parbhat here 👋🏻

I build systems that stay fast under pressure and interfaces that feel effortless to use. My work lives where backend reliability meets product usability - the place where most products succeed or fail.

## Why Me : 

I don’t just code - I build products that work under real conditions. I approach problems end-to-end: designing schemas, shaping APIs, creating interfaces, and deploying to production. I move quickly without cutting corners, and every decision I make prioritizes stability, scalability, and user experience.

Ownership sets me apart. I think like a builder, not just a developer - which means I care about shipping features that matter, not just pushing commits.

## What I’ve Built : 

I’ve taken ideas from whiteboard to production, delivering systems that are fast, reliable, and ready to grow:

Scalable platform → built with Next.js + Node.js + PostgreSQL to handle growing datasets without performance loss.

Authentication system → implemented secure login with NextAuth + JWT, balancing strong security with a smooth sign-in flow.

Real-time collaboration tool → used WebSockets + Redis to sync live data across multiple users with no noticeable lag.

Production pipeline → set up CI/CD with Docker, AWS, and GitHub Actions to ship code from local dev to live in one push.

API layer → designed clean services that remained maintainable as traffic and features scaled up.

Each of these wasn’t about ticking off tech - it was about building something stable, simple, and scalable.

## Beyond Code: 

Good engineering takes a clear head. I reset outdoors - hiking trails, quiet waters, open skies. That same calm focus is what I bring when solving complex system problems: steady, sharp, and reliable.
